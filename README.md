This is an animation software built in Python, intended to display animation frames from plots in R. 
I found it easier to have an external Python software, as opposed to reworking an entire R script to support aniamtions. 
Probably not the techncically correct approach, but it seems to work. 
Sample images have been provided, in the folder images. Ensure to change the path in the python script if not running in a GitHub Codespace.
